# MyStore by Fabian G.

## Description
This project was developed by me for the Udacity course "Angular Fundamentals".
It is an example of an e-commerce website.
Among other things, the features in this example:
- Adding products to cart
- Removing products from cart
- Updating products within the cart overview
- Form validation for user inputs
- Automatic calculation of price total whenever a product is updated within the cart

## Installation
Node and npm need to be installed. 
After that the necessary modules can be installed with `npm install` within the root of the directory.
This will download all modules listed within the [package.json](./package.json) file.

## Development server
A development server can be run by using `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Further help
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
